# ImageSharer
Trying out ReactNative with a basic ImageSharing app

## Running the app
With the [expo app](https://expo.dev) installed both on your phone and the CLI, you can run `expo start` from the root of this directory which will 
run development version of this app on Android, iOS and as a web app. Then scan the generated QR code on your selected device (or visit the localhost address shown)
and you will see the app running.
